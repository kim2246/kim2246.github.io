I'm excited to share that I started my Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering at [UW–Madison](https://engineering.wisc.edu/) and joined the Toyota CSRC project “Toward Responsive Driving Automation.” Our work develops driver management strategies, a theoretical framework of responsive automation, and tools to capture driver–automation interdependencies.
