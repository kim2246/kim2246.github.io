Lee</p> <hr> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <p>Mobility is fundamentally <strong>interdependent</strong>—each driver’s or rider’s decision affects others’ safety, timing, and emotional state. However, transportation research has traditionally optimized for <em>efficiency</em> and <em>risk minimization</em>, neglecting the <strong>social and affective dimensions</strong> that shape well-being.</p> <p>Drawing on two complementary theoretical frameworks:</p> <h3 id="attention-restoration-theory-art">Attention Restoration Theory (ART)</h3> <p>Originally developed in environmental psychology, ART explains how exposure to <strong>natural environments</strong> restores depleted cognitive resources by engaging “soft fascination.”<br> We extended this idea to <strong>social environments</strong>, proposing that <strong>receiving prosocial behaviors</strong>—such as a pedestrian yielding or another rider slowing to make space—functions as a <em>socially restorative cue</em>.<br> Such moments reduce vigilance and cognitive load, restoring attention and emotional balance much like nature exposure does. The effect is hypothesized to engage the <strong>default mode network (DMN)</strong>, linked to empathy, reflection, and self-regulation.</p> <h3 id="game-theory-chicken-game">Game Theory (Chicken Game)</h3> <p>Interdependence was modeled through the <strong>Chicken Game</strong>, where two agents (rider and pedestrian) must decide whether to yield or proceed, each choice influencing the other’s payoff.<br> This framework captures the <strong>reciprocity and mutual risk</strong> of shared road space.<br> Prosocial actions (yielding, coordination) create <strong>Pareto-efficient outcomes</strong> that maximize collective benefit, whereas asocial acts (blocking, rushing) result in <strong>competitive equilibria</strong>—inefficient, stressful, and emotionally depleting.</p> <p>Together, <strong>ART + Game Theory</strong> establish a novel <strong>social-cognitive framework for mobility well-being</strong>: prosocial interactions are not merely moral—they are <em>restorative mechanisms</em> that replenish attention, lower stress, and foster collective harmony.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0a5983e-de68-4638-8094-1d22f8ce0dc6" width="700"><br> <em>Measuring Cognition as an Indicator of Well-being</em> </p> <hr> <h2 id="my-role">My Role</h2> <ul> <li>Designed and implemented the <strong>simulation paradigm</strong> linking social behaviors (prosocial vs. asocial) with cognitive and affective outcomes.</li> <li>Utilized <strong>PANAS</strong>, <strong>STS</strong>, and <strong>Stroop</strong> tasks for emotional and cognitive measurement.</li> <li>Conducted <strong>Linear Mixed Models (LMM)</strong> and <strong>ANOVA</strong>, including visualization of behavioral metrics (TTC, speed, distance) and subjective ratings.</li> <li>Led writing, theoretical integration, and collaboration with <strong>Honda Research Institute USA</strong>.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Participants:</strong> 201 licensed U.S. drivers (20–55 yrs, balanced gender).</li> <li> <strong>Design:</strong> 2 × 3 × 3 mixed design <ul> <li> <em>Between-subject:</em> Sociality (Prosocial vs. Asocial)</li> <li> <em>Within-subject:</em> Time constraint (Relaxed, Neutral, Pressed) × Event (Approach, Merge, Cross)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Apparatus:</strong> Web-based Unity e-scooter simulator (first-person control, realistic physics).</li> <li> <strong>Measures:</strong> <ul> <li> <strong>Behavioral:</strong> Minimum Time-to-Collision (TTC), Speed at Decision, Distance to Pedestrian.</li> <li> <strong>Cognitive:</strong> Stroop task (error rate, median RT for congruent/incongruent stimuli).</li> <li> <strong>Affective:</strong> PANAS (Positive/Negative Affect) and STS (Confidence, Enthusiasm, Ride Quality, Risk).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Analysis:</strong> Linear Mixed Models with Tukey HSD corrections; visualization with ggplot2.</li> </ul> <p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44a46a5c-0d3a-40ee-b7fc-d305c0eec9eb" width="160" height="475"><br> <em>Interdependent scenarios modeled as game-theoretic dilemmas (approach, merge, cross).
