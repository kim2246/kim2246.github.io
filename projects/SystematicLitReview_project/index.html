Safety/efficiency gains alone are insufficient unless <strong>stress, cognitive load, trust, inclusion, and access</strong> are addressed together.</p> <p><strong>Social well-being</strong> ties to social connectedness and inclusion (e.g., whether road users feel respected/accepted in mixed traffic); <strong>economic well-being</strong> links to access and opportunity via reliable mobility, with disproportionate risks for vulnerable groups when access is limited.</p> <h3 id="measurement-toolkit-used-in-the-reviewed-studies">Measurement Toolkit (used in the reviewed studies)</h3> <p>Validated instruments recur across the literature:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>WHO-5</strong> (recent 2-week mental well-being)</li> <li> <strong>STS — Satisfaction with Travel</strong> (affective + cognitive appraisal of trips)</li> <li> <strong>PANAS</strong> (positive/negative affect balance)</li> <li> <strong>WEMWBS</strong> (hedonic + eudaimonic mental well-being) These tools cover general mental well-being, travel-specific satisfaction, and affective states that shift with automation and interaction quality.</li> </ul> <h3 id="empirical-insights-what-helps-vs-what-hurts">Empirical Insights (What helps vs. what hurts)</h3> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Safety &amp; Predictability drive relief.</strong> People feel best when automated behavior is <em>predictably safe</em> (smooth decel/accel, early yielding). Unexpected behavior or rare failures spike acute stress. Vigilance support (monitoring + timely alerts) maintains an optimal engagement state.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Clear communication restores pedestrian trust.</strong> In the absence of a driver’s cues (eye contact, gestures), <strong>eHMI</strong> (lights/text cues) and/or traffic signals increase crossing confidence—<em>provided</em> behavior is consistent. Consistency across vehicles can matter more than novel signals.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prosocial (cooperative) automation reduces conflict and effort.</strong> AVs that yield courteously, leave gaps, and negotiate fairly diffuse tension and lower driver frustration—improving moment-to-moment well-being.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Norm mismatch can increase friction.</strong> Aggressive human drivers may react negatively to over-cautious AVs; unmanaged mismatch raises annoyance and social tension.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="mechanisms-why-it-works">Mechanisms (Why it works)</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Trust calibration</strong> is central: under-trust → chronic anxiety; over-trust → risky disengagement. Interfaces that nudge toward <strong>appropriate engagement</strong> (limits transparency + graded alerts) maximize comfort without eroding safety.</li> <li> <strong>Social signaling</strong> (yield cues, speed trajectory) substitutes for lost driver eye contact and enables smoother human–AV negotiation at crossings and merges.</li> </ul> <h3 id="design--policy-implications-directly-actionable">Design &amp; Policy Implications (Directly actionable)</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Make behavior legible and consistent</strong>: smoother profiles, early slowing for yielding, standardized patterns across fleets to reduce uncertainty.</li> <li> <strong>Use eHMI judiciously</strong> to complement—not replace—predictable vehicle behavior for pedestrians.</li> <li> <strong>Encode prosocial policies</strong> (courteous merging, fair right-of-way) in planning and control to dampen conflict and elevate social/affective experience.</li> <li> <strong>Measure what matters</strong> alongside classic safety/throughput metrics (stress, comfort, travel satisfaction).</li> <li> <strong>Educate users</strong> on capabilities and limits to avoid under-/over-trust.</li> </ul> <h3 id="gaps--open-questions">Gaps &amp; Open Questions</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Social inclusion</strong> is under-measured: few studies quantify whether different groups (e.g., older adults, less tech-savvy users) <em>feel</em> traffic is “for them” in automated contexts.</li> <li> <strong>Longitudinal evidence</strong> is thin: we need months-to-years studies on adaptation, over-trust, and health outcomes.</li> <li> <strong>Vulnerable road users</strong> (pedestrians, cyclists) remain underrepresented relative to in-vehicle research.</li> </ul> <h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Safety + predictability = lower stress and better physical/mental states</strong>, especially when vigilance is supported.</li> <li> <strong>Communicative and prosocial automation</strong> (legible yielding, courteous merges, consistent norms) <strong>improves trust and everyday experience</strong> for drivers and pedestrians.</li> <li> <strong>Use WHO-5 / STS / PANAS / WEMWBS</strong> to capture well-being, travel satisfaction, and affect shifts that automation can influence.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="evidence-table-selected-studies">Evidence Table (Selected Studies)</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Study (Year) &amp; Design</th> <th>Context &amp; Automation Level</th> <th>Well-being Measures</th> <th>Key Findings on Well-being</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> <strong>Sanbonmatsu et al.

Initial monitoring burden caused slight <strong>workload ↑</strong>, but <strong>stressfulness ↓ over time</strong> as drivers became comfortable letting the car handle routine tasks; many felt more relaxed/mind-wandering. <strong>Positive initial attitudes</strong> predicted greater gains.

Interpretation: unfamiliar AV behavior stresses some drivers and provokes risky responses.
