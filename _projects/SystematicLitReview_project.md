## Overview

This project synthesizes evidence on **how AI/automation affects road-user well-being** in mixed (human–AV) traffic. We define well-being across **psychological (stress, trust, comfort), physical (safety, fatigue), social (cooperation, inclusion), and economic/time-use** dimensions, and derive **human-centered design principles**—with emphasis on **prosocial automation** and **trust calibration** for safer, calmer, and more equitable mobility.

### Search Strategy (Boolean logic)

A Boolean search strategy was employed, incorporating terms from three conceptual categories: **(1) Well-being, (2) Automation, and (3) Road users.** The following example illustrates the logic (adapted per database syntax):

* **Well-being constructs:** "well-being" OR "wellbeing" OR "quality of life" OR "mental health" OR "stress" OR "comfort" OR "anxiety" OR "satisfaction"
* **Automation terms:** ("autonomous vehicle*" OR "automated vehicle" OR "self-driving car" OR "vehicle automation" OR "driver assistance" OR "ADAS" OR "automated driving")
* **Human road user terms:** (driver* OR motorist* OR "human driver" OR pedestrian* OR cyclist* OR "road user" OR "mixed traffic" OR "hybrid traffic")

Example boolean string:

```
("well-being" OR wellbeing OR "quality of life" OR "mental health" OR stress OR comfort OR anxiety OR satisfaction)
AND
("autonomous vehicle*" OR "automated vehicle" OR "self-driving car" OR "vehicle automation" OR "driver assistance" OR ADAS OR "automated driving")
AND
(driver* OR motorist* OR "human driver" OR pedestrian* OR cyclist* OR "road user" OR "mixed traffic" OR "hybrid traffic")
```

## Literature Review — What We Learned about Well-being in Hybrid Mobility Societies

### Definition & Framework

We frame **well-being in hybrid mobility** (human + automated road users) across four interdependent dimensions—**physical**, **psychological**, **social**, and **economic/time-use**—and treat them as a connected system rather than siloed outcomes. Safety/efficiency gains alone are insufficient unless **stress, cognitive load, trust, inclusion, and access** are addressed together.

**Social well-being** ties to social connectedness and inclusion (e.g., whether road users feel respected/accepted in mixed traffic); **economic well-being** links to access and opportunity via reliable mobility, with disproportionate risks for vulnerable groups when access is limited.

### Measurement Toolkit (used in the reviewed studies)

Validated instruments recur across the literature:

* **WHO-5** (recent 2-week mental well-being)
* **STS — Satisfaction with Travel** (affective + cognitive appraisal of trips)
* **PANAS** (positive/negative affect balance)
* **WEMWBS** (hedonic + eudaimonic mental well-being)
  These tools cover general mental well-being, travel-specific satisfaction, and affective states that shift with automation and interaction quality.

### Empirical Insights (What helps vs. what hurts)

1. **Safety & Predictability drive relief.** People feel best when automated behavior is *predictably safe* (smooth decel/accel, early yielding). Unexpected behavior or rare failures spike acute stress. Vigilance support (monitoring + timely alerts) maintains an optimal engagement state.

2. **Clear communication restores pedestrian trust.** In the absence of a driver’s cues (eye contact, gestures), **eHMI** (lights/text cues) and/or traffic signals increase crossing confidence—*provided* behavior is consistent. Consistency across vehicles can matter more than novel signals.

3. **Prosocial (cooperative) automation reduces conflict and effort.** AVs that yield courteously, leave gaps, and negotiate fairly diffuse tension and lower driver frustration—improving moment-to-moment well-being.

4. **Norm mismatch can increase friction.** Aggressive human drivers may react negatively to over-cautious AVs; unmanaged mismatch raises annoyance and social tension.

### Mechanisms (Why it works)

* **Trust calibration** is central: under-trust → chronic anxiety; over-trust → risky disengagement. Interfaces that nudge toward **appropriate engagement** (limits transparency + graded alerts) maximize comfort without eroding safety.
* **Social signaling** (yield cues, speed trajectory) substitutes for lost driver eye contact and enables smoother human–AV negotiation at crossings and merges.

### Design & Policy Implications (Directly actionable)

* **Make behavior legible and consistent**: smoother profiles, early slowing for yielding, standardized patterns across fleets to reduce uncertainty.
* **Use eHMI judiciously** to complement—not replace—predictable vehicle behavior for pedestrians.
* **Encode prosocial policies** (courteous merging, fair right-of-way) in planning and control to dampen conflict and elevate social/affective experience.
* **Measure what matters** alongside classic safety/throughput metrics (stress, comfort, travel satisfaction).
* **Educate users** on capabilities and limits to avoid under-/over-trust.

### Gaps & Open Questions

* **Social inclusion** is under-measured: few studies quantify whether different groups (e.g., older adults, less tech-savvy users) *feel* traffic is “for them” in automated contexts.
* **Longitudinal evidence** is thin: we need months-to-years studies on adaptation, over-trust, and health outcomes.
* **Vulnerable road users** (pedestrians, cyclists) remain underrepresented relative to in-vehicle research.

### Key Takeaways

* **Safety + predictability = lower stress and better physical/mental states**, especially when vigilance is supported.
* **Communicative and prosocial automation** (legible yielding, courteous merges, consistent norms) **improves trust and everyday experience** for drivers and pedestrians.
* **Use WHO-5 / STS / PANAS / WEMWBS** to capture well-being, travel satisfaction, and affect shifts that automation can influence.

| **Sanbonmatsu et al. (2024)** — Naturalistic **field** study over 6–8 weeks           | Level 2 (partial automation) used in personal vehicles by novice users                                                  | Self-reported stress & enjoyment; attention/workload; physiological arousal                    | After extended use, **stress ↓** and **enjoyment ↑**. Initial monitoring burden caused slight **workload ↑**, but **stressfulness ↓ over time** as drivers became comfortable letting the car handle routine tasks; many felt more relaxed/mind-wandering. **Positive initial attitudes** predicted greater gains. [1][2][24] |
| **Ma & Zhang (2024)** — **Driving simulator** mixed-traffic encounters                | Human drivers interacting with **AVs vs. human-driven** vehicles; driver style = aggressive/moderate/defensive          | Self-reported **anxiety** & **comfort**; observed gap acceptance and cutting-in                | **Aggressive/moderate** drivers felt **more anxious** and **less comfortable** around AVs and behaved **more aggressively** (e.g., cutting in front of yielding AVs). **Defensive** drivers showed **no change**. Interpretation: unfamiliar AV behavior stresses some drivers and provokes risky responses. [3][25]          |
| **Khattak & Lin (2023)** — **Simulation-based modeling** (analytic)                   | No human subjects; autonomous driving **scenario factors** from literature                                              | Composite **mental stress value** from perceived safety, ride comfort, workload, value of time | Model shows **perceived safety** is the **strongest** stress reducer, followed by **comfort** and **reduced workload**. Suggests **stress reduction** should be treated as a key **benefit** in AV adoption models. [26][27][28]                                                                                              |
| **Kim et al. (2024)** — **Online simulation** of interaction strategies               | Drivers exposed to **prosocial vs. competitive** AV behaviors (merge/chicken scenarios)                                 | Anticipated mood & stress scales; possibly physiological stress; driving behavior              | Hypothesis & prelim. evidence: **prosocial, predictable, considerate** AV behavior (e.g., polite yielding) **reduces stress/anxiety** and improves satisfaction; **aggressive** behaviors raise stress. Highlights **social climate** as a well-being dimension. [9]                                                          |
| **Teodorovicz et al. (2022)** — **Online survey** (N≈400 commuting knowledge workers) | Manual commuting now; **anticipated** activities in **future fully self-driving** cars                                  | Current vs. desired commute activities; attitudes about using commute time                     | Participants expect a safe AV would enable **productive/leisure “me time”** → potential **life-satisfaction ↑**. **Trust/reliability** is the hinge: benefits appear **only if** they can divert attention **without anxiety**. [10][11]                                                                                      |
| **Jayaraman et al. (2019)** — **VR experiment** on pedestrian–AV crossing             | Pedestrians cross in front of an approaching **AV**; **defensive vs. aggressive** AV style; with/without traffic signal | **Trust** in AV; crossing hesitation/time                                                      | **Defensive** AV + **conventional signal** → **trust ↑** and more willing/decisive crossing. **Aggressive** AV without clear signals → **trust ↓** and hesitation ↑. Well-being for vulnerable road users depends on **clear, predictable** AV behavior. [8]                                                                  |

## Selected Examples (Design Patterns)

* **Takeover UX:** progressive alerts → brief rationale (“slowing for cut-in”) → countdown → confirmation.
* **eHMI for pedestrians:** early deceleration + front-light “Yield” cue → higher crossing confidence.
* **Prosocial merge:** AV leaves a cooperative gap and signals intent → lower human driver stress/aggression.
