<!-- Overview -->
**Venue:** AHFE International Conference on Human Factors in Robots and Unmanned Systems (2019; Springer proceedings 2020)  
**Status:** Published  
**Authors:** SooYeon Kim, Young Hoon Oh, and Da Young Ju

### Overview
We investigated **tactile and visual interaction preferences** for elderly-friendly companion robots.  
Through controlled user studies with older adults, we examined how specific interaction modalities shape **comfort, usability, and acceptance**.

### My Role
- Study design & protocol development  
- Stimuli/interface variants (tactile/visual) preparation  
- Data collection with older adults; analysis & reporting

### Methods
- **Participants:** Older adults (lab-based user study)  
- **Measures:** Preference ratings, qualitative feedback, usability indicators  
- **Analysis:** Descriptive + inferential statistics; design factor synthesis

### Outcomes
- Design considerations for **touch & visual cues** that improve comfort and acceptance.  
- Actionable guidelines for elderly populations.  
- Published in AHFE (Springer proceedings, 2020).

## Background

Social connections in our life help us in improving the quality and well-being of our lives. However, chances of being socially connected decrease in the cases of older adults, making them vulnerable to depression.
In 2017, South Korea had ofcially become an aged society, with more than 14 percent of its citizens 65 years old or older. It took only 17 years after South Korea became an aging society in 2000, while Japan took 24 years for the same transition (Chosun 2017). Companion robots can satisfy their needs since they are developed as technological intervention tools by providing service, companionship, and assistance in daily life.
In this project, our goal was to first understand the needs of older adults, evaluate the designed concepts, and finally prototype a companion robot.

Above figure shows the collected companion robot designs from older adults and the final concept design was selected as (a) animal character type considering the design and robot functionalities. With the animal character design, we could avoid uncanny valley effect (from the previous study) and 244 older adults responded that they prefer animal (bear, dog, seal) designs. Many older adults particularly mentioned that the robot design should bring warm (like bear) and familiar (like dog) feelings to the users.

## Overview

## Related Project — TDRC Living-Lab (2018)
Digital companion robot design program at **Yonsei University Technology and Design Research Center (TDRC)**.  
A multi-phase initiative to understand older adults’ needs, prototype concepts, and evaluate them in a **living-lab** setting.

**Project window:** April 2018 — Dec 2018  
**Core phases:** Initial interviews, focus-group interviews, living-lab trials, concept design & prototype selection

### Study Flow (high level)
- **Initial interviews:** Large-N screening with older adults to map needs/contexts  
- **FGI:** Caregivers & active seniors to refine problem space and feasibility  
- **Living-lab (2 weeks):** In-home instrumentation (sensors, AI speaker) to observe routines and pain points  
- **Concept design:** Multiple visual/tactile forms → **final “animal-type” concept**

### Companion Functions (need themes → robot features)
- **Safety & independence:** find misplaced items; hazard/abnormality alerts; routine monitoring & emergency handling  
- **Health & care:** medication reminders; vitals/activities monitoring; telemedicine support  
- **Social & daily life:** call/meet friends & family; photo display; program/event reminders; exercise prompts  
- **Affective rapport:** familiar **animal-like character**, warm tone/voice (e.g., grandchild-like), friendly presence
