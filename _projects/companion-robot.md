<!-- Project Meta -->
**Venue:** AHFE International Conference on Human Factors in Robots and Unmanned Systems (2019; Springer proceedings 2020)  
**Status:** Published  
**Authors:** SooYeon Kim , Young Hoon Oh, and Da Young Ju

## Overview
This project investigated **which physical design attributes—type, weight, and material—older adults prefer in companion robots**.  
Building on the **2018 large-scale concept design study (N=244)**, which identified animal-like robots as preferred and highlighted key functional needs, this study advanced into **controlled experimental testing** with older adults.  

**Key Findings**  
- **Weight:** Women strongly disliked robots heavier than 2 kg.  
- **Material:** Microfiber was most preferred, plastic least.  
- **Context:** Living alone vs. with others influenced synthetic fur preference (comfort vs. hygiene).

## My Role
- Conceived and led the **experimental study**.  
- Designed prototypes for **type, weight, and material** testing.  
- Conducted data collection with older adult participants.  
- Statistically Analyzed results (Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis tests).  
- Synthesized design guidelines

## Methods
- **Participants:** 15 older adults (mean age ≈ 58; 80% female; 27% living alone).  
- **Stimuli:**  
  - *Types:* bear, seal, dog, humanoid, newborn baby.  
  - *Weights:* 150 g → 2.65 kg across six increments.  
  - *Materials:* silicone, microfiber, synthetic fiber, plastic.  
- **Procedure:** Hands-on evaluation + 5-point Likert ratings.  
- **Analysis:** Nonparametric tests by gender, age, living arrangement.

## Background

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31dc2f72-1c04-4c56-b2ca-08aaf38712d8" alt="aging context" width="600" /><br>
  <em>Image Source: Aging of South Korea in 2020 (Kee Whan Kim et al.)</em>
</p>

South Korea became an aged society in 2017, with >14% of its citizens over 65. Older adults face higher risks of isolation and depression. Companion robots are positioned as **technological interventions** that provide assistance, safety, and companionship.  

### Prior Concept Design Study (2018)
A large-scale survey & living-lab experiment (N=244) explored older adults’ design preferences:  

- **Animal-like characters** (bear, dog, seal) preferred over humanoids → reduced *uncanny valley effect*.  
- Desired qualities: warmth, familiarity, friendliness.  
- Functions clustered into **safety & independence, health & care, social & daily life, and affective rapport**.

</p>

These findings informed the **variables tested in 2019** (type, weight, material).  

## Concept Functions

- **Safety & independence:** misplaced item search, hazard alerts, emergency handling.  
- **Health & care:** medication reminders, vital monitoring, telemedicine support.  
- **Social & daily life:** family calls, event reminders, photo display, exercise prompts.  
- **Affective rapport:** animal-like character, warm tone/voice, friendly presence.  

## User Scenario Examples

## Experiment Setup
The questionnaire included the following items:
Section A: Demographic information (gender, age, and living arrangement);
Section B: Design elements (type, weight, and material of companion robots).

*Stuffed animal toys and a humanoid robot used in the Type test*

*Stuffed dogs are used in the Weight test*

*Material panel is used in the Material test*


## Outcomes
- Lightweight (<2 kg), **soft-textured robots** are most accepted.  
- **Microfiber consistently outperformed** silicone, synthetic fiber, and plastic.  
- Gender and living context strongly shape acceptance patterns.  
- Findings offer **specific, actionable design guidelines** for elderly-friendly companion robots.
