<!-- Project Meta -->
**Venue:** AHFE International Conference on Human Factors in Robots and Unmanned Systems (2019; Springer proceedings 2020)  
**Status:** Published  
**Authors:** SooYeon Kim , Young Hoon Oh, and Da Young Ju

## Overview
This project investigated **which physical design attributes—type, weight, and material—older adults prefer in companion robots**.  
Building on the **2018 large-scale concept design study (N=244)**, which identified animal-like robots as preferred and highlighted key functional needs, this study advanced into **controlled experimental testing** with older adults.  

**Key Findings**  
- **Weight:** Women strongly disliked robots heavier than 2 kg.  
- **Material:** Microfiber was most preferred, plastic least.  
- **Context:** Living alone vs. with others influenced synthetic fur preference (comfort vs. hygiene).

## My Role
- Conceived and led the **experimental study**.  
- Designed prototypes for **type, weight, and material** testing.  
- Conducted data collection with older adult participants.  
- Statistically Analyzed results (Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis tests).  
- Synthesized design guidelines

---

## Methods
- **Participants:** 15 older adults (mean age ≈ 58; 80% female; 27% living alone).  
- **Stimuli:**  
  - *Types:* bear, seal, dog, humanoid, newborn baby.  
  - *Weights:* 150 g → 2.65 kg across six increments.  
  - *Materials:* silicone, microfiber, synthetic fiber, plastic.  
- **Procedure:** Hands-on evaluation + 5-point Likert ratings.  
- **Analysis:** Nonparametric tests by gender, age, living arrangement.  

---

## Outcomes
- Lightweight (<2 kg), **soft-textured robots** are most accepted.  
- **Microfiber consistently outperformed** silicone, synthetic fiber, and plastic.  
- Gender and living context strongly shape acceptance patterns.  
- Findings offer **specific, actionable design guidelines** for elderly-friendly companion robots.

## Background

*Image Source: Aging of South Korea in 2020 (Kee Whan Kim et al.)*  

South Korea became an aged society in 2017, with >14% of its citizens over 65. Older adults face higher risks of isolation and depression. Companion robots are positioned as **technological interventions** that provide assistance, safety, and companionship.  

### Prior Concept Design Study (2018)
A large-scale survey & living-lab experiment (N=244) explored older adults’ design preferences:  

- **Animal-like characters** (bear, dog, seal) preferred over humanoids → reduced *uncanny valley effect*.  
- Desired qualities: warmth, familiarity, friendliness.  
- Functions clustered into **safety & independence, health & care, social & daily life, and affective rapport**.

These findings informed the **variables tested in 2019** (type, weight, material).

- **Safety & independence:** misplaced item search, hazard alerts, emergency handling.  
- **Health & care:** medication reminders, vital monitoring, telemedicine support.  
- **Social & daily life:** family calls, event reminders, photo display, exercise prompts.  
- **Affective rapport:** animal-like character, warm tone/voice, friendly presence.
