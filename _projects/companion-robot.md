<!-- Project Meta -->
**Venue:** AHFE International Conference on Human Factors in Robots and Unmanned Systems (2019; Springer proceedings 2020)  
**Status:** Published  
**Authors:** SooYeon Kim (lead), Young Hoon Oh, and Da Young Ju

## Overview
This project investigated **design elements that shape elderly users’ acceptance of companion robots**, focusing on the **physical attributes**—type, weight, and material. Unlike earlier large-scale concept design work (2018, N=244), which explored *animal vs. humanoid forms and functional themes*, my study moved into **controlled experimental testing** with older adults to understand **which tactile and visual features actually matter in practice**.  

Findings revealed that preferences varied by **gender, living arrangement, and age group**:  
- Women strongly disliked robots heavier than 2 kg.  
- Older adults living alone preferred *synthetic fur* textures, while those living with others rejected them due to hygiene concerns.  
- Across groups, **microfiber was consistently the most preferred material**, while plastic was least favored.

## My Role
- **Project Lead:** Conceived and designed the experimental protocol.  
- Developed **stimuli prototypes** (five robot types, six weight levels, four material panels).  
- Conducted **data collection & analysis** with elderly participants (SPSS, nonparametric tests).  
- Synthesized design implications into **actionable guidelines for HRI designers**.  
- First author of the AHFE publication.

## Methods
- **Participants:** 15 older adults (mean age ≈ 58; 80% female; 27% living alone).  
- **Stimuli:**  
  - Robot *types*: bear, seal, dog, humanoid, newborn baby.  
  - *Weights*: 150 g → 2.65 kg (six increments).  
  - *Materials*: silicone, microfiber, synthetic fiber, plastic.  
- **Procedure:** Hands-on interaction + Likert-scale preference ratings.  
- **Analysis:** Nonparametric Mann–Whitney tests across gender, living arrangement, and age groups.

## Outcomes
- **Material Matters:** Microfiber ranked highest; plastic lowest.  
- **Weight Sensitivity:** Females showed a sharp decline in acceptance when weight > 2 kg.  
- **Contextual Differences:** Older adults living alone showed higher preference for synthetic fur, possibly due to its comforting familiarity.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Companion robots for older adults should be lightweight (<2 kg), soft-textured (microfiber), and animal-inspired in type to maximize acceptance.

With South Korea transitioning into an aged society faster than any OECD nation, addressing **loneliness and depression in older adults** is a pressing social issue. Companion robots are seen as potential solutions, offering emotional comfort and daily assistance without the challenges of pet ownership.  

The **2018 living-lab study** (N=244) identified that older adults prefer **animal-like robots (bear, dog, seal)** over humanoid forms, largely to avoid the *uncanny valley effect*. Building on that foundation, this AHFE project advanced to **controlled testing of tactile and material preferences** to inform **real-world design specifications**.
