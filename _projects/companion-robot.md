<!-- Project Meta -->
**Venue:** AHFE International Conference on Human Factors in Robots and Unmanned Systems (2019; Springer proceedings 2020)  
**Status:** Published  
**Authors:** SooYeon Kim, Young Hoon Oh, and Da Young Ju

## Overview
This project explored **how elderly users perceive and accept companion robots**, with a focus on tactile and visual interaction modalities. We combined controlled lab studies with large-scale surveys and living-lab prototyping to understand older adults’ needs, derive design requirements, and test concept designs.  

Our findings highlighted that **animal-inspired designs with warm and familiar aesthetics** (e.g., bear, dog, seal) mitigate the *uncanny valley effect* and increase acceptance, while specific tactile/visual cues improve comfort and usability.

## My Role
- **Led user study design**: developed protocols for tactile/visual interaction tests with older adults.  
- **Prepared concept stimuli**: created variants of companion robot interfaces for evaluation.  
- **Conducted data collection & analysis**: preference ratings, qualitative feedback, and usability metrics.  
- **Synthesized design factors** into actionable guidelines for elderly-friendly robotics.  

---

## Methods
- **Participants:** Older adults (lab-based user study; survey N=244).  
- **Measures:** Preference ratings, qualitative interviews, usability indicators.  
- **Analysis:** Descriptive & inferential statistics; thematic synthesis of user needs.  
- **Living-Lab Evaluation:** Iterative prototyping with older adults to refine design and functionalities.  

---

## Outcomes
- Defined **design considerations for tactile & visual interactions** that improve elderly users’ comfort and acceptance.  
- Validated that **animal-character designs** evoke warmth and familiarity, avoiding uncanny valley effects.  
- Derived functional requirements (safety, health monitoring, social connectivity, affective rapport) for next-generation companion robots.  
- Published in **AHFE (Springer proceedings, 2020)**.

*Image Source: Aging of South Korea in 2020 (Kee Whan Kim et al.)*  

By 2017, South Korea had officially become an aged society, with over 14% of citizens 65+ years old. Rapid demographic changes increase risks of isolation and depression among older adults. Companion robots offer a technological intervention — providing daily assistance, safety monitoring, and emotional companionship.  

This project addressed the critical question: **How should we design robots that older adults actually want to live with?**

## Concept Designs
<img width="1776" height="346" alt="designs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/205166be-930a-469c-b733-78ff9d185737" />

From a multi-phase initiative (survey N=244, 2018), older adults co-designed companion robot concepts. **Animal-character designs** emerged as most desirable, balancing familiarity, warmth, and functional adaptability.  

**Robot Functions (mapped to user needs):**
- **Safety & independence:** find misplaced items; hazard alerts; emergency response.  
- **Health & care:** medication reminders; vitals monitoring; telemedicine support.  
- **Social & daily life:** calls with family/friends; event reminders; photo display.  
- **Affective rapport:** animal-like character, warm tone/voice, child/grandchild-like friendliness.
