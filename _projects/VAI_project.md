**Venue:** Ergonomics Society of Korea Annual Conference (2020)

## Overview
This project examined whether **physiological signals** (EEG, HRV) can be used to evaluate user experience (UX) of **interactive TV systems with voice-based conversational interfaces**. Traditional UX evaluation relies heavily on subjective questionnaires, which are limited by recall bias. We explored physiological measures as **objective, real-time indicators** of user engagement, workload, and emotional state.  

**Key Contribution**  
- Proposed a **multimodal evaluation framework** combining self-report and physiological signals.  
- Demonstrated that EEG and HRV correlate with perceived workload and satisfaction, validating their use for UX research in conversational systems.  

---

## My Role
- Designed and executed the **user study protocol**.  
- Collected and preprocessed EEG and HRV signals.  
- Conducted statistical analysis linking physiological metrics with UX ratings.

## Background
The rapid adoption of **voice-based and conversational systems** (smart TVs, smart speakers) requires new methods to evaluate UX. Traditional surveys capture only post-task reflections, while physiological data can reveal **real-time cognitive and emotional states**.  

This project aligned with emerging research in **affective computing** and **multimodal HCI evaluation**, bridging lab-based physiological methods with applied UX contexts.

## Methods
- **Participants:** Adult users (N ≈ 20) interacting with conversational TV interface.  
- **Tasks:** Controlled interaction scenarios (e.g., channel change, content search, voice commands).  
- **Measures:**  
  - **EEG**: attention, workload indices.  
  - **HRV**: stress and emotional valence indicators.  
  - **Self-report questionnaires** (NASA-TLX, satisfaction ratings).  
- **Statistical Analysis:** ANOVA for task differences; correlation analysis between physiological and subjective measures.

## Outcomes
- EEG frontal theta power increased during cognitively demanding tasks, aligning with higher NASA-TLX workload scores.  
- HRV indices reflected stress levels consistent with subjective reports.  
- Demonstrated feasibility of **using physiological data as complementary UX indicators**.  
- Proposed methodology later adopted in HCI and affective computing studies.
