Hi, thanks for stopping by! 👋  

I specialize in **Human Factors & Human–Automation Interaction**, working with [Prof. John D. Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qd6nZCAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the Cognitive Systems Lab.  

My research centers on designing **human–automation systems** that work seamlessly with people. I study how psychology-based interventions and prosocial interactions shape road users’ well-being, cognition, behavior, and safety—drawing on collaborative projects with the [Honda Research Institute](https://usa.honda-ri.com) and [Toyota CSRC](https://amrd.toyota.com/division/csrc). I take a **mixed-methods UX approach**, moving fluidly between quantitative measures (VR, simulators, physiological data) and qualitative insights (interviews, journaling, and text relfections) to capture the full picture of human experience and translate it into actionable design.  

My work has been published at venues such as **HFES**, **ACM AutomotiveUI**, and **IEEE IEEM & SMC**, covering **prosocial driving, mobility well-being, and user experience with voice interfaces, conversational agents, and robotics**.  

Outside of research, I enjoy golfing ⛳ and am a tea person 🍵 who loves exploring new blends as much as new ideas.
