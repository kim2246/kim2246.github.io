## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m **Soo Yeon Kim**, a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, specializing in **Human Factors Engineering** and **Human–Automation Interaction**. I work closely with [Dr. John D. Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qd6nZCAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), exploring how human cognition, emotion, and behavior interact with automation and emerging technologies.  

My research combines **mixed-methods UX approaches**—from large-scale experiments and physiological measurements to interviews and journaling studies—to understand how people think, feel, and act when interacting with complex systems. Much of my work focuses on **transportation and mobility**: exploring how prosocial behaviors in traffic, cooperative design, and trust in automation can shape well-being 🌱, safety 🚦, and user experience.  

I enjoy bridging human insights with technical design: developing experiments in **Unity**, analyzing cognitive and behavioral data with **Python/R**, and translating findings into actionable design recommendations. This blend of qualitative and quantitative perspectives helps me design user-centered systems that are both scientifically rigorous and practically meaningful.  

Beyond research, I’m passionate about **UX research roles** where I can connect human behavior with product innovation. And when I’m not thinking about experiments or design problems, I’m very much a tea person ☕—you’ll often find me exploring new blends and tea shops around town.  

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim2246/) or check out my academic work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wRR6mioAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). ✨
