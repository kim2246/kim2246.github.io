## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m **Soo Yeon Kim**, specializing in **Human Factors Engineering** and **Human–Automation Interaction**. I work closely with [Dr. John D. Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qd6nZCAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), exploring how human cognition, emotion, and behavior interact with emerging technologies.  

My research combines **Mixed-methods UX approaches** - from large-scale experiments and physiological measurements to interviews and journaling studies - to understand how people think, feel, and act when interacting with complex systems. Much of my work focuses on **transportation and mobility**: defining and exploring how prosociality can shape well-being 🌱, safety 🚦, and user experience.  

I enjoy bridging human insights with technical design: developing experiments in **Unity**, analyzing cognitive and behavioral data with **Python/R**, and translating findings into actionable design recommendations. This blend of qualitative and quantitative perspectives helps me design user-centered systems that are both scientifically rigorous and practically meaningful.  

Based on my research, I’m passionate about **UX research roles** where I can connect human behavior with product and systeminnovation.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim2246/) or check out my academic work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wRR6mioAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). ✨
