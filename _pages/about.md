Hi, thanks for stopping by! 👋
I specialize in **Human Factors** and **Human–Automation Interaction**, working with [Dr. John D. Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qd6nZCAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) to study how human cognition, emotion, and behavior interact with emerging technologies.  

My research uses **mixed-methods UX approaches**—from experiments and physiological measures to interviews and journaling—to understand how people think, feel, and act in complex systems. Much of this work centers on **transportation and mobility**, where I explore how prosociality shapes well-being 🌱, safety 🚦, and user experience.  

I enjoy bridging human insights with design: building experiments in **Unity**, analyzing behavioral data with **Python/R**, and translating findings into actionable design recommendations. This mix of qualitative and quantitative methods helps me create systems that are both rigorous and user-centered.  

I’m passionate about **UX research roles** that connect human behavior with product and system innovation.  
Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim2246/) or check out my academic work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wRR6mioAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) ✨
