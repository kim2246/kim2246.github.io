Hi, thanks for stopping by! 👋  

I specialize in **Human Factors** and **Human–Automation Interaction**, working with [Dr. John D. Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qd6nZCAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as part of the Cognitive Systems Lab to study how human cognition, emotion, and behavior interact with emerging technologies.

My research uses **Mixed-methods UX approaches**—from quantitative data such as simulators, VR, surveys, and physiological devices (HR and ECG) to qualitative data such as speech (interviews), text (journals, reflections)—to understand how people think, feel, and behave in complex systems. Much of this work focuses on **transportation and mobility**, where I explore how to model road users’ behaviors, well-being, safety, and overall experience.

I enjoy bridging human insights with design: designing experiments, building simulated traffic scenarios in **Unity**, analyzing behavioral data with **Python/R**, and translating findings into actionable design recommendations.  

I’m passionate about **UX research roles** that connect human behavior with product and system innovation.
